### Building Scalable Networks on AWS

#### Overview

Welcome to the 'Building Scalable Networks on AWS' workshops portal. The hands-on lab contents contained in this portal are focused on AWS Networking services and concepts. They will guide you through prepared scenarios that represent common Networking build use-cases on AWS cloud and aimed at helping you gain a good understanding of how you could build scalable networks on AWS. The content is a series of simple learn-it-by-doing labs. We have put together an FAQ about the workshop as below

#### FAQs

**What is the purpose of the workshop?**

The purpose behind creating the workshop is to enable anyone who wants to learn AWS Networking concepts, typically as a weekend learning project

**Who is the target audience?**

Network administrators, network architects, cloud architects, application developers and anyone with a technical background who wants to learn the concepts of AWS Networking by doing. Also, targeted for folks typically begining on AWS cloud and planning to move workloads in near-future

**What is the structure of the workshop?**

The workshop is a series of labs and each lab will have a single learning objective. As you proceed your way through the labs, you will touch upon multiple aspects of AWS Networking Services while simultaneously building a step by step an increasingly scaled network on AWS

**How long will each lab take to complete?**

We have structured the labs in such a way that any single lab will not take more than 30 minutes

**Are there any pre-requisites for the Lab?**

You need an AWS account to start trying the labs. If you don't have an AWS account, you can create yourself one by following the steps as documented here: https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/

Any other lab pre-reqs are covered as part of the individual lab material

**What is the cost associated to run any of the labs?**

We have shared an approximate cost to run a particular lab at every lab's index page

**Do the labs require any pre-work?**

Yes. If you are an absolute newbie to AWS, you might want to go through some pre-work material, so that, the concepts given in the lab become easier to understand. However, if you already have some background of AWS, you can directly jump on to the lab.

The pre-work needed for each lab is documented in each of the lab's index page

**I don't have any prior AWS experience. Can I directly start the workshop?**

Prior AWS knowledge helps, however, if you do not have any AWS experience you can still take the workshop, in which case, we recommend you to go through the pre-work before you try the lab hands-on

**What AWS Services will be covered in this workshop?**

We plan to touch upon these AWS Networking services, features and concepts - VPC, Elastic Load Balancer,VPC Peering, Transit Gateway, Route53, CloudFront, VPN (Site to Site), Client VPN, VPC Endpoints & PrivateLink and GlobalAccelerator

**Are the labs going to be console based or any other mechanism?**

Labs will use AWS console, CLI and CloudFormation
