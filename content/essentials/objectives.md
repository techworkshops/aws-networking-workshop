High Level Objectives of the lab are to gain familiarity in: 
-	Creating a stack for n-tier architecture
-	Different components of the VPCn
-	Launch EC2 instances into the VPC
-	Assign a public IP address (EIP) and test public/private connectivity.

The only pre-requisite for this lab is to have an AWS account. If you dont have one already please refer: [AWS Account Creation](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/)

Note:  Screenshots are provided to guide you through the steps in the lab. The elements that you will create (e.g. VPC, NAT Gateway, EIP) will be unique to your account, so things such as VPC ID that you see in the console will not necessarily mirror whatâ€™s seen in the screenshot.
